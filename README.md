Instruction on how to use the Calender:
Please download all the files and place them in the same directory. Then run the index.html file. Do not remove local storage keys from the inspect element, it will break the program. 

Future Considerations 
-add a remove event button to remove certain events in the calender.
-Have default national holidays in the calender
